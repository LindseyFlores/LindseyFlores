# Hello World! I'm Lindsey Flores 👋
I am currently finishing up my Computer Science Degree at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where I have obtained a great portion of my programming knowledge.
During my enrollment, I have been working at **6-TECH**, the technology department at the university. Here I have gained experience in systems analysis, hardware management
and worked with the cloud-computing service SERVICENOW platform.

### 👩‍💻 My main programming languages: 
- **Javascript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **Java**. <br />
And I enjoy using **Figma** for my designing needs, to help me get a better visual of my final goal. <br />
### Reach Out!
Best way to reach me is going to be my email (profe.linaf.1@gmail.com) <br/>
I dont spend too much time on social media, but if you would like to learn some more about me, be sure to take a look at my personal website listed on my github profile 😊.
<br/>
Happy coding!
