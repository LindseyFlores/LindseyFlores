# Hey! I'm Lindsey Flores ðŸ‘‹
I am currently finishing up my Computer Science Degree at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where I have obtained a great portion of my programming knowledge.
During my enrollment, I have been working at **6-TECH**, the technology department at the university. Here I have gained experience in systems analysis, hardware management and worked with the cloud-computing service SERVICENOW platform.

My main programming languages: 
- **Javascript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **Java**.
And I enjoy using **Figma** for my designing needs, to help me get a better visual of my final goal.
